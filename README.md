For this challenge I used Bootstrap 5. I had an hard time trying to center the block vertically, but after some research I finally managed to do it. I learned a lot about creating responsive layouts using Bootstrap and Flexbox, including how to make an image responsive and how to adjust width and height of columns. 

### Built With
